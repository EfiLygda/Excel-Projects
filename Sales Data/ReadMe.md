# Sales Data EDA

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on understanding sales patterns across customers, regions, and order statuses. 
The analysis leverages descriptive statistics and visualizations to generate insights into pricing, product lines, and sales behavior.
In this project, dynamic arrays were mostly used to answer the questions, without relying on traditional pivot tables, except for the use of the PIVOTBY() function in one instance, as indicated below.

------------------------

## Project Structure

The whole project is located in workbook `Sales_Data_Project.xlsx`, which contains the following four worksheets:

- `Table of Contents`: A simple TOC that links to the location of the dataset, each question and the small dashboard included.
- `Data`: The sales dataset used for the analysis.
- `S1. Answers`: Contains the answers to the questions for the analysis.
- `S2. Small Dashboard`: Contains a small dashboard providing a quick summary of the product lines by each order status
